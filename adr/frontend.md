# Architecture Decision Record: Frontend Framework Selection

## Status

Accepted (April 27, 2025)

## Context

We are developing a web application for organizing meetups where users can create events, register for meetings, and interact with other participants. The application requires interactive UI elements such as modals, choice lists, comment sections with auto-refresh capabilities, and notifications. The development is being carried out by a single developer with intermediate frontend experience, working part-time with a 3-month timeline for the initial working version.

Key considerations include:
- Need for a flexible framework that can support future scaling
- Requirement for responsive design to avoid creating a separate mobile app
- Complex state management for features like auto-refreshing comments and notifications
- Integration with a Python/Starlette backend
- Development by a solo developer with intermediate frontend experience
- Performance needs focused on application responsiveness rather than initial load time

## Decision

We will use **React** as the frontend framework and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## Rationale

### React Selection Rationale:

1. **Scalability**: React's component-based architecture is well-suited for applications that need to scale extensively in the future.
2. **Flexibility**: React offers significant flexibility in implementation approaches, which was identified as a top priority.
3. **Ecosystem**: React has the largest ecosystem among the considered options (React, Vue.js, Svelte), providing access to numerous libraries and community solutions.
4. **State Management**: For complex state management requirements like auto-refreshing content, React offers mature solutions like Redux, Context API, and React Query.
5. **Community Support**: As a solo developer working part-time, access to extensive documentation, examples, and community support will accelerate development.
6. **Responsive Design**: React's component structure facilitates responsive design implementation.

Other frameworks considered:
- **Vue.js**: While having a gentler learning curve, it offers less flexibility and a smaller ecosystem than React.
- **Svelte**: Though excellent for performance, it has a smaller ecosystem and potentially more challenges for extensive scaling.

### Tailwind CSS Selection Rationale:
1. **Flexibility**: Tailwind's utility-first approach provides maximum flexibility for custom UI development.
2. **React Integration**: Tailwind works seamlessly with React's component model.
3. **Performance**: Tailwind can be optimized to produce smaller CSS bundles in production.
4. **Component Libraries**: Access to growing ecosystem of Tailwind-based component libraries.
5. **Custom Design**: Ability to create a unique look and feel rather than a generic Bootstrap appearance.

Bootstrap was considered but rejected due to its more opinionated design approach and less flexibility, despite offering more ready-to-use components.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Highly flexible architecture that can scale with future requirements
- Strong ecosystem support for the development timeline
- Good performance characteristics for interactive elements
- Excellent responsive design capabilities
- Better long-term maintainability and customization

### Negative:
- Potentially steeper initial learning curve compared to Bootstrap for styling
- May require more upfront development time for custom components compared to using Bootstrap's pre-built components
- Will need to select and integrate third-party libraries for certain features

## Implementation Notes
- Will need to establish consistent component patterns early in development
- Consider using React component libraries compatible with Tailwind CSS to accelerate development
- Should implement a state management solution appropriate for the application's complexity
- Will need to configure Tailwind for optimal production performance
